# Bitcoin Options 0DTE Strategy Optimization

This project aims to optimize a **naked call** and **naked put** trading strategy for Bitcoin options, specifically focusing on **zero days to expiration (0DTE)** contracts.

## Project Overview

The strategy involves opening option positions **24 hours before expiration** to collect premiums. Using machine learning, the model predicts whether a Bitcoin option is likely to expire **in-the-money (ITM)** or **out-of-the-money (OTM)**. Based on these predictions and a calibrated confidence threshold, the algorithm decides whether to write a call or put option to **maximize expected returns**.
